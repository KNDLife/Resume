#### Fabric AI Project

My fabric AI project was created to provide an opportunity to increase my study power.  This project based on Daniel Miessler's Fabric utilizes the fabric patterns to develop a wide range of study materials.  Being able to use patterns to extract videos transcripts, summarize documents or perform other pattern based tasks enable improved learning.
The extract_wisdom pattern was used to ["Extract Wisdom"](/fabric/Python_Video_Wisdom.html) the following wisdom from a Python video.
